This repository is part of the materials used in the **Music Information Retrieval (MIR)** course within the  
[**Sound and Music Computing (SMC)**](https://www.upf.edu/web/smc) programme  
at the **Music Technology Group (MTG), Universitat Pompeu Fabra**.

---

The course offers a broad overview of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), a multidisciplinary field drawing from diverse areas such as signal processing, machine learning, music theory, and cognition. Participants delve into how to apply this knowledge to different tasks in MIR, like extracting meaningful features from music representations and implementing indexing, search and retrieval schemes. The course provides insights into the diverse aspects of MIR, with an emphasis on standard research and development methodologies.


#### The notebooks

The notebook are intended for addressing some traditional MIR tasks. The fundamentals of the techniques are discussed during the course lectures. 

Please refer to the [Fundamentals of Music Processing (FMP)](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/mueller/bookFMP) book for a great introduction to some essential topics in MIR.
